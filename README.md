# MF810-Final-Project

## Topic: Extraction and visualization of COVID-19 articles important key words 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). CORD-19 is a resource of over 500,000 scholarly articles, including over 200,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. The data set consists of multiple types of data including csv files, json files, etc.
We plan to use this data to find out the article topics people interested in by extracting important key words and plotting the clusters of the articles. 
## Data:
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset

## Methodology: 
SQL, Spark, NLP techniques
## Implementation:
We plan to process the data using techniques we learnt in class, such as SQL, Spark, MapReduce, etc. Then we use techniques in Natural Language Processing to extract important keywords from the articles, and then cluster similar articles and visualize our result in a plot.
